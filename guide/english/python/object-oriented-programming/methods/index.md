## Methods

Methods are used so that they will be called when initated when called later on.

    class Number:
      
      def __init__(self)
         return
         
      def greater_than_1(self,n):
         return n > 1
      
      >>> a = Number()
      >>> a.greater_than_1(1)
      False
      >>> a.greater_than_1(2)
      True
